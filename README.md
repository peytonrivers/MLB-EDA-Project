# ⚾ MLB Home Run EDA Project

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of MLB player statistics, with a focus on calculating the **average number of home runs per player on each team**. The goal was to practice essential data science skills by working with real-world sports data and visualizing meaningful insights.

---

## 📊 Objective

Analyze an MLB dataset to calculate the average home runs per player by team and visualize the results using a bar graph.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive coding and documenting

---

## 🧠 Key Skills Practiced

- Importing and exploring data using `df.head()`, `df.tail()`, `.shape`, `.isnull().sum()`, and `df.duplicated()`
- Filtering data by condition (e.g., `df[df['Team'] == team]`)
- Writing custom functions to compute average values
- Creating bar graphs using `matplotlib.pyplot`
- Improving code readability with clean structure and comments
- Understanding `.shape[0]` to count rows (number of players)

---

## 📈 Final Output

A bar chart displaying the **average number of home runs per player** on each MLB team. This visual helps quickly identify which teams had the most home run production on a per-player basis.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project taught me how to:
- Properly import, clean, and analyze a dataset
- Write functions to compute group-level insights
- Visualize findings in a clean and appealing format

I look forward to building more data projects like this to sharpen my skills and continue my journey to becoming a professional data scientist.
